# Platform (Phase A)

This repo is now a Next.js app. Phase A's only goal was to introduce the
Next.js app layer **without changing how any existing page looks or
behaves**. Nothing about the legacy site's markup, styling, or behavior was
touched.

## Important: source branch used for this conversion

`platform` was branched from `feature/ai-chatbot-and-projects`, **not** from
`main` (the repo's default branch). This is a deliberate deviation from a
literal "branch from default" instruction, made because `main` turned out to
be stale relative to what's actually deployed at
`https://chennunagavenkatasai.com`:

- The live page's HTML is byte-identical (same MD5 / same ETag Vercel
  reports) to `index.html` on `feature/ai-chatbot-and-projects`, and
  differs substantially from `main`'s `index.html` (85,314 bytes vs.
  69,732 bytes — different project-card markup/CSS entirely).
- `feature/ai-chatbot-and-projects` also carries the "Ask Naga" chatbot
  (`chatbot.js`/`chatbot.css` + the `api/chat.js` Vercel Edge Function and
  its helpers), the 13 project cover-art images referenced by the current
  page, and `vercel.json`. `main` has none of these. The security headers
  in `vercel.json` (`X-Content-Type-Options`, `Referrer-Policy`,
  `Permissions-Policy`) match the live response headers exactly.
- `main` is a strict git ancestor of `feature/ai-chatbot-and-projects`
  (verified with `git merge-base --is-ancestor`), so this carries no
  divergent-history risk — it's a superset, not a fork.

Building from `main` would have meant serving a page that doesn't match
production, which conflicts with the prime directive of this phase. A
reviewer should confirm this was the right call — the likely explanation is
that Vercel's "Production Branch" setting for this project points at
`feature/ai-chatbot-and-projects` rather than `main`, and `main` simply
never got merged up. That's a repo/Vercel hygiene question for the owner to
resolve outside of this phase; this phase did not touch `main`, GitHub, or
any Vercel setting.

## Conversion approach

The legacy site is kept as **untouched static files under `public/`**,
served at their original relative paths. Nothing was hand-converted to JSX.

- `public/index.html` — the legacy single-page site, byte-for-byte the same
  file that was at the repo root before this conversion.
- `public/chatbot.css`, `public/chatbot.js` — the "Ask Naga" chat widget
  front end, referenced by `index.html` via plain relative `href`/`src`.
- `public/profile.png`, `public/img.JPG`,
  `public/Naga_Venkata_Sai_Chennu_Career_Fair_Resume.pdf`,
  `public/assets/projects/*.jpg` — every image/asset `index.html`
  references, at the same relative paths it already used.
- `next.config.mjs` adds a single rewrite, `/` → `/index.html`, so the site
  root keeps serving that exact file. No other legacy routes exist (this is
  a one-page site; the only in-page navigation is `#anchor` links).
- The legacy Vercel Edge Function that powers the chatbot
  (`api/chat.js`, `api/_llm.mjs`, `api/_persona.mjs`) is left **at the repo
  root**, untouched, outside of `app/`. This is intentional: Vercel deploys
  a top-level `api/` directory as Serverless/Edge Functions independently of
  whatever frontend framework is in use, so leaving it exactly where it was
  is the lowest-risk way to keep it working once this is actually deployed.
  Next.js itself is unaware of this directory (it only looks at `app/`),
  so it cannot break the Next build, but it also **cannot be exercised by
  `next dev`/`next start` locally** — see Verification note below.
- Non-site reference material (`docs/`, `tests/`, `Venkat Portfolio Design
  System/`, `CHATBOT_SETUP.md`, `.env.local.example`, `scripts/`) is left in
  place at the repo root, unchanged. None of it is referenced by
  `index.html`, so none of it belongs in `public/`.
- `vercel.json` is kept as-is at the repo root. Its `redirects` (project
  card → external demo links) and `headers` (security headers on every
  route) are a platform-level Vercel config independent of the framework —
  Vercel honors it whether the project is "static" or "Next.js", so it did
  not need to be ported into `next.config.mjs`.

## New Next.js surface (everything added this phase)

- `app/layout.js` — minimal root layout (required by the App Router). It
  only wraps `app/`-rendered routes (`/blog`); it never wraps the legacy
  static page, which bypasses React entirely.
- `app/api/health/route.js` — `GET /api/health` → `{ "ok": true }`.
- `app/blog/page.js` — placeholder `/blog` page. Its colors and font stack
  (`--ink #171411`, `--paper #fbf7ec`, `--lime #caff60`, the
  `Inter, ui-sans-serif, system-ui...` stack) are copied verbatim from
  `public/index.html`'s `:root` custom properties, not reinvented.

No database, no auth, nothing else. That's intentional for this phase.

## Running locally

```bash
npm install
npm run dev      # next dev — serves the legacy site at "/", /api/health, /blog
npm run build && npm run start   # production build
```

The chatbot's own local dev loop is unchanged and separate from Next:

```bash
cp .env.local.example .env.local   # add OPENROUTER_API_KEY
npm run dev:chatbot                # scripts/dev-server.mjs, per CHATBOT_SETUP.md
```

`next dev`/`next start` do **not** serve `/api/chat` — that endpoint only
exists as a Vercel Edge Function once actually deployed to Vercel, or via
the standalone dev server above. This phase did not deploy anywhere, so
that endpoint was not (and could not be) exercised as part of verification.

## Phase roadmap

Phase A (this phase): Next.js app layer + legacy site preserved verbatim.
Later phases: `/admin`, Supabase, an ingestion gate, X automation.

## Security scan notes (Snyk)

- `postcss` (a transitive dependency `next@15.5.20` pins to an exact
  vulnerable version, `8.4.31` — GHSA-qx2v-qp2m-jg93, moderate, XSS via
  unescaped `</style>` in CSS stringify output) is pinned up to `8.5.16` via
  an `overrides` entry in `package.json`. This isn't a new top-level
  dependency, just a version constraint on an existing nested one.
  `npm audit` reports 0 vulnerabilities after this change, and the build/all
  verification steps below still pass with it in place.
- Snyk Open Source (`snyk_sca_scan`) flags two CVEs against `next@15.5.20`
  itself, with no fixed release inside the Next 15 line (both fixes only
  landed in Next 16.x):
  - **CVE-2025-59472** (high, CWE-770) — unbounded memory allocation via the
    Partial Prerendering resume endpoint. **Not applicable here**: it only
    triggers when `experimental.ppr`/`cacheComponents` and
    `NEXT_PRIVATE_MINIMAL_MODE=1` are set, none of which this project
    configures (`next.config.mjs` only sets `rewrites` and `images`).
  - **CVE-2026-27980** (medium, CWE-400) — the default `/_next/image`
    optimizer endpoint caches unbounded variants to disk with no eviction,
    letting an attacker exhaust disk space by requesting many `w`/`q`
    combinations. This endpoint exists by default on any Next.js app
    regardless of whether `next/image` is used in code — and nothing in
    this app uses it (legacy images are plain `<img>` tags served
    statically). Mitigated by setting `images.unoptimized: true` in
    `next.config.mjs`; verified empirically that `/_next/image` now 404s
    instead of processing requests, with the rest of the app (root page,
    static assets, `/api/health`, `/blog`) still serving correctly
    afterward.
  - Neither CVE was addressed by upgrading `next` itself, because the task
    for this phase explicitly pins to "latest stable Next 15" and no fixed
    15.x release exists (fixes are 15.6.0-canary.61 — not stable — or
    16.1.5/16.1.7). **A reviewer should decide** whether staying on 15.5.20
    (with the mitigation above) is acceptable long-term, or whether a
    later phase should move to Next 16.
- Snyk Code (SAST) on the whole repo reports one pre-existing medium finding
  (`javascript/HttpToHttps`, CWE-319) in `scripts/dev-server.mjs:126`,
  where `node:http.createServer` is used. This file was carried over
  unmodified from `feature/ai-chatbot-and-projects` (not written or touched
  in this phase) and is a local-only dev helper explicitly bound to
  `127.0.0.1` with a host-header allowlist (see the file's own comments) —
  plain HTTP on loopback is standard practice for local dev servers
  (`next dev` itself does the same). Left as-is rather than "fixed", since
  changing it would mean rewriting pre-existing, working, documented dev
  tooling outside this phase's scope for a finding that doesn't apply to
  its actual deployment (production runs on Vercel over HTTPS; this script
  never runs there).
  Scanning just the code added in this phase (`app/`) separately reports
  zero issues.
